This software is developed by:
    Paris Blaisdell-Pijuan
    Jacob Bryon
    Joseph Sartini
    Youssef Elasser 
    Zach Hervieux-Moore

@ Prineton University in December 2019. It was developed for use in the Gmachl
Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering for the control of a quantum
cascade laser (QCL) and the data collection using a Zurich Instruments (ZI)
Lock-In amplifier.

Software Scope:
    This software contains two different modes. The first is an experiment mode
    that takes in set inputs and produces set outputs. These experiments are
    designed for basic laser spectroscopy and include:
        1. Wavelength Scan
        2. Current Scan
        3. Time Scan
        4. Determine Extinction Coefficient
        5. Determine Cavity Loss
    The second mode is a data sandbox that loads sets of data and allows
    manipulation and plot generation of that data.

## Running Unit Tests

To run all unit tests, run `python -m unittest discover` in the `/src` folder.
